Hi, I'm Jennifer Gonzalez. I love crime, particularly homicide. I took criminal forensics courses in college. Having chosen Github to practice my projects and build a portfolio, I am interested in collaborating on any projects that will increase my skill set and technical knowledge. All experience is good experience! Currently enrolled in school, I am studying front end coding, data analytics and cybersecurity. I alos love karaoke!
